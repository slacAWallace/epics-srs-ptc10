PTC 10
The SRS temperature controller can be configured using a variety of cards which are plugged into the back.
There are 5 slots.
Every channel on the PTC10 is given a default name, usually with the slot number as the prefix and A, B, C, ... as the suffix.
Adding to the complexity of the system is the ability to rename the channels as you see fit.

CRITICAL: To make the IOC work, you must make sure your channel names match what is actually on the controller.

########################################
PTC440, Thermoelectric device driver
########################################
Each PTC440 card has a TEC driver channel, a voltage sensing channel (this is the voltage on the actual TEC itself),
and some sort of temperature readback device channel (used for the PID).

To add a PTC440 to your IOC, add the following to your st.cmd:
dbLoadRecords( "db/PTC440_TECDriver.db", "TEC=<TEC Driver>,RB=<Temperature Readback>,VMON=<Voltage Sense>,P=<Asyn Port and PV prefix>" )


########################################
PTC330 Thermocouple card
########################################
Each PTC330 card has 4 thermocouple channels that can be used for temperature readback.

To add a PTC440 to your IOC, add the following to your st.cmd:
dbLoadRecords( "db/PTC330_TC.db", "A=<A Thermocouple Name>,B=<B Thermocouple Name>,C=<C Thermocouple Name>,D=<D Thermocouple Name>,P=<Asyn Port and PV prefix>" )
